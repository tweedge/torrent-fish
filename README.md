torrent-fish is a *metadata-only* BitTorrent peer built with libtorrent. It's designed to help keep magnet links which rely on [HTTP Seeding](https://wiki.vuze.com/w/HTTP_Seeding) healthy, without the overhead of running other peers or seeds.

Ok, you might think - but what's the point of a metadata-only peer?

### The Gap Between Magnets and HTTP Seeding

What? No way. You might have even used a magnet with an HTTP Seed before! Everything worked fine, right?

#### Scenario 1. Active Swarm + HTTP Seeds: Works!

A normal swarm with HTTP Seeds works well! It's economic, and helps diversify the content sources, and if the swam is healthy enough the HTTP Seed could even deactivate to save bandwidth. You can use a torrent or a magnet to start the download, and everything should work to get you that file quickly.

In the diagram below, make a quick note of the division between the original BitTorrent protocol and the two extensions providing functionality in this situation.

#### Scenario 2: No Swarm + HTTP Seeds + You Get a Magnet: *Doesn't work!*

Now, the gap you might have seen in the above diagram is very real: while the magnet specification ([BEP9](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0009.html)) provides a mechanism for peers to retrieve a torrent's metadata from other peers, *neither it nor either HTTP Seeding extension ([BEP17](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0017.html) and [BEP19](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0019.html)) provide a mechanism to fetch the torrent metadata from the HTTP Seeds.*

So if client has a magnet and nobody is in the swarm to provision them with a copy of the torrent, they can't fetch any content and will stall. *This is very bad!*

![Image 2](https://github.com/tweedge/torrent-fish/blob/main/diagrams/2_client_has_magnet_with_only_http_seeds.png?raw=true)

*Note that magnets can include HTTP Seeds, but the inclusion of an HTTP Seed does **not** provide sufficient information for the torrent client to fetch the torrent metadata itself, and therefore the filenames/byte-ranges to request from that HTTP Seed are unknown to the client. This is why the download will stall if there are no peers or seeds in the swarm.*

#### Scenario 3: No Swarm + HTTP Seeds + You Get a Torrent: Works!

But for the sake of completeness, if you do manage to get the torrent metadata (either from a peer or by starting with the torrent), you can download the entire torrent's contents from the HTTP Seed, so...

#### Scenario 4: No Swarm + HTTP Seeds + You Get a Magnet + The Uploader Used torrent-fish: Everything is fixed!

So, torrent-fish provides a solution to scenario 2. If the swarm is reasonably expected to be empty *at least sometimes*, torrent-fish is a lightweight script which performs the only essential task of a peer in that swarm: provisioning new peers with torrent metadata. After the torrent metadata has been provisioned to the new peer, the peer can use the HTTP Seed(s) to retrieve the content itself.

torrent-fish intentionally does not download any pieces of the torrent, so it can maintain as small a footprint as possible - it ensures the *health* of HTTP Seeded torrents, not availability or speed. Because of this narrow focus, torrent-fish is cheap, easy, and reliable - in certain situations, it should even be *much* cheaper than running a full-time seed in a usual torrent client.

### Torrenting for Archivists

So, this seems... niche. In what situations is torrent-fish even relevant?

Well, BitTorrent is fantastically thrifty for large groups of people looking to share specific files online, with each contributing their own bandwidth and resources to provide the files to each other person who is requesting those files. The original uploader does not even bear exclusive (or even the majority) cost for distributing files, and popular torrents can live for years after the original uploader stopped seeding their own file.

That doesn't mean that BitTorrent is the economic choice for all situations, though. BitTorrent expects clients in swarms simultaneously to exchange files - as such, it's rarely a choice for archival storage. A seeder looking at the long term needs to be online all the time, with reasonable frequency (if permitted for their torrent's availability needs), or have some mechanism of determining when it needs to be woken up. These options are pricy, inconvenient, or both.

One way to address this is by using GetRight-style HTTP Seeding, which instructs torrent clients to treat certain HTTP or FTP sources as seeds for a given torrent. That way, no dedicated system is needed to serve the content of a torrent - especially if the HTTP Seed is using now-commodity object storage or a CDN - which can lower cost *in certain situations* compared to even the cheapest virtual machine serving the torrent 24/7.

*An aside: this is [how the Internet Archive distributes data via torrents](https://help.archive.org/help/archive-bittorrents/), they specifically use torrents + HTTP Seeds for the above reasons. A torrent file is provided for for downloads, which allows HTTP Seeds to be utilized, plus anyone else in the swarm can donate bandwidth to help distribute content. The Internet Archive does not provide magnets, as those cannot be converted to torrents without running a torrent client, which is expensive.*

But, torrents are not the best option for every situation - magnet links are much smaller and can be posted wherever text input is allowed, so they show up on many more websites than torrents do. For the rogue archivist, or for people passing data around on social websites (ex. social media, forums, etc.), magnets may be competitively convenient.

So, torrent-fish is certainly niche, but not useless.

### Usage

Generally, to get started with torrent-fish you should make a directory of torrents that need to have their metadata served. Providing torrent-fish with that directory plus the default options should work in the vast majority of cases:

```
% python3 torrent-fish.py -l <directory_with_torrents>
```

However, the current list of available options is available with the --help flag:

```
% python3 torrent-fish.py --help
Usage: torrent-fish.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PORT, --port=PORT  set listening port
  -i LISTEN_INTERFACE, --listen-interface=LISTEN_INTERFACE
                        set interface for incoming connections
  -o OUTGOING_INTERFACE, --outgoing-interface=OUTGOING_INTERFACE
                        set interface for outgoing connections
  -d MAX_DOWNLOAD_RATE, --max-download-rate=MAX_DOWNLOAD_RATE
                        the maximum download rate given in kB/s. 0 means
                        infinite.
  -u MAX_UPLOAD_RATE, --max-upload-rate=MAX_UPLOAD_RATE
                        the maximum upload rate given in kB/s. 0 means
                        infinite.
  -c CONNECTIONS_LIMIT, --connections_limit=CONNECTIONS_LIMIT
                        the global limit on the number of connections opened.
  -l LOAD_PATH, --load-path=LOAD_PATH
                        the path where the downloaded file/folder should be
                        placed.
  -r PROXY_HOST, --proxy-host=PROXY_HOST
                        sets HTTP proxy host and port (separated by ':')
```

#### Examples

Artifacts to help bootstrap torrent-fish in the following environments are included in the "examples" directory:

* Fly ([https://fly.io](https://fly.io/))

#### Efficiency

The Docker container for torrent-fish is very small, only about 40MB compressed. When run in a [Firecracker microVM](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) on [Fly](https://fly.io/), the entire torrent-fish instance consumes about 80MB of RAM and several KB/s of bandwidth. This fits easily into Fly's smallest current offering - 1 core, 256MB RAM - *and* customers currently get three of those instances free-forever (as of May 2022).

#### Under the Hood

[libtorrent](https://www.libtorrent.org/) is a popular library that implements BitTorrent - you might use a BitTorrent client that also uses libtorrent, such as [Deluge](https://deluge-torrent.org/) or [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/). torrent-fish wraps libtorrent with pretty simple settings applied to every torrent:

* Each piece's priority is set to 0 (do not download)
* `upload_mode` flag is enabled, so torrents are active but not downloading data
* `auto_managed` flag is disabled, so torrents should not enter a downloading state automatically

It should be possible to accomplish the desired results by using *either* setting the piece priorities *or* mucking about with the flags for each torrent, but I occasionally ran into issues where libtorrent would begin to request pieces (BitTorrent is supposed to download missing/corrupt pieces, after all!) and doing both doesn't seem to cause any problems.

The script was originally a fork of Fran√ßois M.'s [retrieve.py](https://gist.github.com/francoism90/4db9efa5af546d831ca47208e58f3364) due to his clean usage of [libtorrent's bindings for Python](https://www.libtorrent.org/python_binding.html), though we accomplish very different goals with libtorrent. Francois' script gets a torrent from a magnet and exits; torrent-fish stays alive for as long as possible to convert any peer's magnet into a torrent.
